# Database Management Project
Duration: **6 weeks** (Oct'22 - Nov'22)

Task: Design and implement a database that helps to solve a real-world problem. Then, build a simple webpage capable of running queries and fetching data from the database.

Solution: **NaijaSports**. I designed logical data models using **Draw.io** and created a **MySQL** database locally. I then built a webpage using **HTML**, **PHP** & **JavaScript**, connected it to the database, and used **Google Cloud Platform** to host both the webpage and database.
